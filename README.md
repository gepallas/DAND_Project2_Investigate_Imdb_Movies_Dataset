This project has been completed as part of the [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) requirements.

## Overview
The imdb movies dataset has been analyzed and an exploratory analysis has been performed.

- First, a data screening has been performed and research questions have been identified.

- Secondly, the data have been cleaned and relevant variables to answer the research questions have been selected.

- Then, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) has been performed to identify correlations between variables and revenues and profits.

- Finally, detailed visulizations present the findings, and conclusions and limitations are discussed.

Research questions that have been explored:

1. Are the popularity, budget and vote count being correlated with revenues (adjusted)?
2. Which genres have the highest revenues each year and decade?
3. Which genres have the highest profits each decade?
4. Which are the most popular genres each year?
